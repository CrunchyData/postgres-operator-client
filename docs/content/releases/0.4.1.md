Crunchy Data announces the release of `pgo`, Postgres Operator Client from Crunchy Data 0.4.1.

Built as a `kubectl` plugin, the `pgo` CLI facilitates the creation and management of PostgreSQL clusters created using [Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes][].

For more information about using the CLI and the various commands available, please see the [`pgo` CLI documentation][].

Additionally, please see the [CPK documentation](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest) for information about [getting started](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/quickstart/) with Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes.

## Bug 
- The `support export` command would fail fatally if the user didn't have permissions to list postgresclusters at the cluster-scope. This release fixes that so our postgrescluster list fails gracefully (like our other atttempts to gather Kubernetes resources).
