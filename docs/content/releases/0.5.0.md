Crunchy Data announces the release of `pgo`, Postgres Operator Client from Crunchy Data 0.5.0.

Built as a `kubectl` plugin, the `pgo` CLI facilitates the creation and management of PostgreSQL clusters created using [Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes][].

For more information about using the CLI and the various commands available, please see the [`pgo` CLI documentation][].

Additionally, please see the [CPK documentation](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest) for information about [getting started](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/quickstart/) with Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes.

## Features

- The `pgo create` command now includes a `--disable-backups` flag.  By providing this flag, you can fully disable backups in your PostgresCluster. NOTE: Backups are only able to be disabled when using PGO v5.7+.
- The `support export` command now includes:
    - Logs from all Postgres replicas
    - Better support for large logs
    - The output of the `pgbackrest check` command
    - `pg_controldata` from each Postgres instance
